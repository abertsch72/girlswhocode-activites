Now that you've seen some variables, let's get new values for each madlib.
You can get input from the user like this:

my_variable = input("Please give me a value: ")

You can change the text in the input() to say whatever you want! Be sure to
tell the user which part of speech you need.

Also, variables can change value! Let's change things up so that the same
words aren't used for each madlib.

Rewrite the code from madlibs-a to ask the user for values before printing each
madlib. To help, the variables needed for each one are listed right before the
madlib prints out. :)

adjectives -- descriptive words, like "green" or "funny" or "large"
adverbs -- words describing verbs, like "quickly" or moodily" or "angrily"
nouns -- people, places, and things, like "my friend George" or "goats" or "Seattle"
