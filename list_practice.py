# Practice with lists

coffee = ["water", "coffee beans", "time", "heat"]

# How do we get "time" out of the coffee list? Print it out using indexing. 




# How do we add "milk"? Add it to the coffee list, then print out the list. 



# Never mind, I don't want to add milk. I want to add sugar. How do I change the list?
# Print out the list result.




# I want a cold brew. This doesn't use heat. Print out the list. Add and remove whatever you like
# in a coffee!







# Make at least three sentences out of the given list by only adding things from the list by indexing. 
# Hint: There is a way to find the index of an item in a list. See if you can Google for the answer!

sentence_making = ["chair", "market", "his", "at", "pushes", "open", "nighttime", " ", ",", 
                    "fruit", "to", "spilled", "is", ".", "laptop", "ground","that", "onto", "late", 
                    "games", "there", "what", "come", "how", "where", "some", "the", "exit",
                    "backpack", "ran",  "small", "car", "broken", "closed", "close", "later"]









# Lists have a lot of other functions. If you have time, ask a facilitator for functions like pop(), 
# reverse(), insert(), etc.
