"""
Sometimes, to help understand the code we want to write, it's helpful to write
it out in words before we write it out in code. These conditionals have been
written out (described) in words. Can you help write them in Python?

Also, make sure to test your code! Try changing the values of x, y, z, and u.
Before you run the code, write down what you think it should print out. Then,
make sure you're right!

x = 12
y = 42
z = 11
u = int(input("Enter a number! "))

# this example has been done for you!
# if z is equal to x, print "z = x"; otherwise, print "z = x ? that's not true"
if (z == x):
    print("z = x")
else:
    print("z = x ? that's not true")

# TODO: now try the other four conditionals! Make sure to test your work

# if x is greater than or equal to y print "hi!"; if this isn't true, print "oh ok :("


# if z is more than 2 or z equals -10 print "z is valid"


# if z is equal to u and x is less than or equal to y, print "u = z";
# otherwise, if x is greater than z, print "z < x" (hint: don't print
# this if z is equal to u and x is less than or equal to y)
# otherwise, if none of these conditions are true, print "sorry try again"


# if u is the smallest of those numbers, print "u is small"
# if u is the largest, print "u is large"
# if u is the second smallest or second largest, print "u is not that small or large"
