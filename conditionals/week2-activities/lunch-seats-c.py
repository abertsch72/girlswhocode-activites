"""
This is a logic puzzle game!

There are four people, A, B, C, and D. They want to sit together according
to some very specific rules:
1. C picks their seat first.
2. B wants to sit next to C but never next to D
3. A wants to sit on the end, unless that would mean B has to sit next to D

Given the seat that C sits in, what's the order they'll sit down in?
"""
import random

seat_C = random.randint(1, 4)

# What are the four possible orderings? If C sits in seat 1, seat 2, seat 3, or seat 4
# write them out here
# if C sits in seat 1:
# if C sits in seat 2:
# if C sits in seat 3:
# if C sits in seat 4:

# use conditionals to print the correct ordering!
