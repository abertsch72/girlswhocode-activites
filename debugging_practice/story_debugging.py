print("There once two children who wanted to explore the world of " + 
"Adanac. This is a world where everything goes -- you can fly, you can talk" +
"to animals, you can do whatever you want."

print("Adanac is a wonderful place. A slight breeze in a balmy 75 degrees", end='')
print("is probably the perfect temperature, and the water is always perfectly " +
"warm, but not too warm.")

print("Let's call these two kids Erin and Rory. Erin and Rory turned the corner +
in their neighborhood, and suddenly they found themselves in Adanac!")

print("Erin said, "Let's get on those turtles and go flying!"")

 print("Rory immediately agreed.")

print "Several humongous turtles, probably the size of the U of A main library " +
"building, sat quietly on the grass. When Rory clambered onto one and Erin " + 
"onto another, however, they started moving. With a few steps, the two gentle giants " +
"were rising, and the two hung on tightly to the ridges in the turtles' shells as " +
"they soared higher and higher."

print("They flew just high enough that the rest of the people milling ")
print("down on the ground look like specks.")
print(""Look over there!" Erin exclaimed.")
print("Rory looked where Erin was pointing. Farther beyond the shore, they")
 print("could see dolphins gracefully leaping and swimming, ")
print("creating a beautiful show of silver flashes again and again.")

print("\"I see five dolphins,\" Rory said.")
print("\"There's one more over there!\" Erin said.")
print("\"That's " + 5+2 + "dolphins total, right?\" Rory said.")
print("\"No, you dummy,\" Erin said good-naturedly, \"five plus one is " + 5+1.)
print('"Shoot, you're right," Rory said. "Thanks!"')

print("For the rest of the day, they explored the world of Adanac. They " + 
"tried all the different foods, talked to all the different people, " + 
"and at the end of the day, they turned the corner again -- and they were back in " + 
"their neighborhood. Back home. They parted ways, agreed they'd go to Adanac " + 
"again in the future given the chance, and went home.")
