# Math practice:

# Problem 1: How do we get the string "True or False?"
# Hint: Don't forget about casting! 
# Print your result to the console (the page to the right) by using print statements.

something = "True"
something_else = False




# Problem 2: What is the result of adding the variables below, in order from top to bottom?
# Print out the result.

car = "water"
wheel = "12"
garden = " flowers"





# Problem 3: How can we get it to print the variable below 20 times, in one string?

forever = "100"



# Problem 4: What if we change the variable above to:

new_forever = int(forever)

# What happens when we use the same format as Problem 3 to try printing it 20 times? 



# Problem 5: Quick maths -- what's 432 * 12 + 99? 




# Try casting, adding, multiplying, and printing the variables in any of the problems 
# to any other type of variable. What happens if we cast a string to a boolean?
